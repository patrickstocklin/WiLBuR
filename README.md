# WiLBuR
WiLBuR is a reddit-bot which, upon being called (responds to account name: /u/WritingLevelBot), replies to the caller with their parent-comment's Flesch-Kincaid Writing Level and Readability Ease Score. For language processing, WiLBuR uses python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) as a lexical resource for tokenizing sentences into usable words. WiLBuR utilizes the PRAW module for interacting with reddit's API. Once calculated, WiLBuR replies to its caller with the fetched results.

WiLBuR may be modified to work with any reddit account which is interested in finding comments or interest given a submission-object. One only needs NLTK's punkt data package, which can be found on their website above, a reddit account, and PRAW installed on their machine.
